# New FTChinese Native iOS App

## Overall Goal
The aim of this project is to create a "mother of all news apps". When the project is finished, anyone who knows the basics of iOS development should be able to build a decent news app in a few minutes. For now, we have two milestones.

### News Reader
### Billigual Support
### Channels
### Advertising
### In-app Purchase

## Enhancement to existing hybrid app
### All possible customizations in one place
### Smooth Panning between content
### Pull to refresh
### Infinite Scrolling in Home and Channel Pages
### Dynamic Type Support
### Autorenewing Subscription
### JSON formating that supports as many as possible APIs
### Newspaper experience on iPad
